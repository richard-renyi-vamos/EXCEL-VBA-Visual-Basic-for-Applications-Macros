create a VBA code that merges 2 Excel files on Sharepoint
ChatGPT
Sure, I can help with that! Merging two Excel files stored on SharePoint using VBA involves a few steps. Here's a detailed guide on how to achieve this:

Set up references in VBA:

Open Excel.
Press Alt + F11 to open the VBA editor.
Go to Tools -> References.
Check "Microsoft Scripting Runtime" and "Microsoft XML, v6.0" (or the latest version available).
Create the VBA code:

vba
Copy code
Sub MergeExcelFiles()
    Dim SharepointURL1 As String
    Dim SharepointURL2 As String
    Dim LocalPath1 As String
    Dim LocalPath2 As String
    Dim DestinationPath As String
    Dim WB1 As Workbook
    Dim WB2 As Workbook
    Dim DestWB As Workbook
    Dim WS As Worksheet
    Dim CopyRange As Range
    Dim LastRow As Long

    ' Define SharePoint URLs
    SharepointURL1 = "https://yoursharepointsite/documents/ExcelFile1.xlsx"
    SharepointURL2 = "https://yoursharepointsite/documents/ExcelFile2.xlsx"
    
    ' Define local paths for temporary download
    LocalPath1 = Environ("TEMP") & "\ExcelFile1.xlsx"
    LocalPath2 = Environ("TEMP") & "\ExcelFile2.xlsx"
    
    ' Define the destination path
    DestinationPath = Environ("TEMP") & "\MergedExcelFile.xlsx"

    ' Download the files from SharePoint
    DownloadFileFromSharePoint SharepointURL1, LocalPath1
    DownloadFileFromSharePoint SharepointURL2, LocalPath2

    ' Open the downloaded files
    Set WB1 = Workbooks.Open(LocalPath1)
    Set WB2 = Workbooks.Open(LocalPath2)

    ' Create a new workbook for the merged data
    Set DestWB = Workbooks.Add

    ' Copy data from the first workbook
    For Each WS In WB1.Sheets
        WS.Copy After:=DestWB.Sheets(DestWB.Sheets.Count)
    Next WS

    ' Copy data from the second workbook
    For Each WS In WB2.Sheets
        WS.Copy After:=DestWB.Sheets(DestWB.Sheets.Count)
    Next WS

    ' Save the merged workbook
    DestWB.SaveAs DestinationPath

    ' Close the workbooks
    WB1.Close False
    WB2.Close False
    DestWB.Close False

    ' Inform the user
    MsgBox "Files merged successfully and saved at " & DestinationPath, vbInformation
End Sub

Sub DownloadFileFromSharePoint(SharepointURL As String, LocalPath As String)
    Dim xmlHTTP As Object
    Dim bStrm As Object
    Set xmlHTTP = CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0")
    xmlHTTP.Open "GET", SharepointURL, False
    xmlHTTP.Send
    If xmlHTTP.Status = 200 Then
        Set bStrm = CreateObject("ADODB.Stream")
        bStrm.Type = 1 'binary
        bStrm.Open
        bStrm.Write xmlHTTP.responseBody
        bStrm.SaveToFile LocalPath, 2 'overwrite
        bStrm.Close
    Else
        MsgBox "Failed to download file from " & SharepointURL, vbCritical
    End If
End Sub
Explanation of the Code:
Define Variables:

SharepointURL1 and SharepointURL2 store the URLs of the Excel files on SharePoint.
LocalPath1 and LocalPath2 store temporary local file paths.
DestinationPath stores the path for the merged Excel file.
WB1, WB2, and DestWB represent the workbooks.
Download Files from SharePoint:

The DownloadFileFromSharePoint subroutine uses MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0 to download the files from SharePoint and save them locally.
Merge the Files:

The code opens the downloaded Excel files and creates a new workbook.
It copies sheets from the first and second workbooks to the new workbook.
The merged workbook is then saved to the specified location.
Clean Up:

The original and merged workbooks are closed.
A message box informs the user about the successful merge and the location of the saved file.
Make sure to replace the URLs and paths with actual values specific to your setup. This code assumes that you have appropriate permissions to access and download files from SharePoint. üòäüìäüíªüìùüîÑüöÄüíºüìÅüîíüîß
