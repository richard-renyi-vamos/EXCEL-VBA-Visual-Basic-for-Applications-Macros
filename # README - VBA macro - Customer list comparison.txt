Create a VBA code that adds a column to an Excel file on a Sharepoint that checks which customers are included from column A (in the original Excel) in another excel file (column A). 

For the customers present in both it should show the customer name, the other ones should stay empty

Creating a VBA code to achieve this requires several steps. Here's the code that should work for your requirements. This code will:

Open the SharePoint Excel file.
Check each customer in Column A of the original Excel file against Column A of the SharePoint Excel file.
Add a new column to the original Excel file and populate it with customer names that are found in both files.
Here is a detailed step-by-step code for this process:

vba
Copy code
Sub CheckCustomersInSharePoint()
    Dim wsOriginal As Worksheet
    Dim wsSharePoint As Worksheet
    Dim originalLastRow As Long
    Dim sharePointLastRow As Long
    Dim originalCustomer As String
    Dim foundCustomer As Range
    Dim i As Long

    ' Define the SharePoint file path and worksheet name
    Dim sharePointFilePath As String
    Dim sharePointSheetName As String
    sharePointFilePath = "https://yoursharepointsite.com/yourfolder/yourfile.xlsx"
    sharePointSheetName = "Sheet1" ' Change this to the actual sheet name in the SharePoint file

    ' Set the original worksheet
    Set wsOriginal = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1") ' Change this to the actual sheet name in the original file

    ' Add a new column to the original worksheet
    wsOriginal.Columns("B").Insert Shift:=xlToRight
    wsOriginal.Cells(1, 2).Value = "Customer Check"

    ' Get the last row with data in the original worksheet
    originalLastRow = wsOriginal.Cells(wsOriginal.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row

    ' Open the SharePoint workbook
    Dim sharePointWorkbook As Workbook
    Set sharePointWorkbook = Workbooks.Open(sharePointFilePath, ReadOnly:=True)

    ' Set the SharePoint worksheet
    Set wsSharePoint = sharePointWorkbook.Sheets(sharePointSheetName)

    ' Get the last row with data in the SharePoint worksheet
    sharePointLastRow = wsSharePoint.Cells(wsSharePoint.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row

    ' Loop through each customer in the original worksheet
    For i = 2 To originalLastRow ' Assuming the first row is headers
        originalCustomer = wsOriginal.Cells(i, 1).Value
        If originalCustomer <> "" Then
            ' Check if the customer is in the SharePoint worksheet
            Set foundCustomer = wsSharePoint.Columns("A").Find(What:=originalCustomer, LookAt:=xlWhole)
            If Not foundCustomer Is Nothing Then
                ' If found, add the customer name to the new column
                wsOriginal.Cells(i, 2).Value = originalCustomer
            Else
                ' If not found, leave the cell empty
                wsOriginal.Cells(i, 2).Value = ""
            End If
        End If
    Next i

    ' Close the SharePoint workbook without saving
    sharePointWorkbook.Close SaveChanges:=False

    MsgBox "Customer check completed!"

End Sub
Explanation:
Variables and Setup:

wsOriginal: The worksheet in your original Excel file.
wsSharePoint: The worksheet in the SharePoint Excel file.
originalLastRow, sharePointLastRow: Determine the last row with data in each worksheet.
originalCustomer: Holds the customer name from the original file.
foundCustomer: Checks if the customer exists in the SharePoint file.
Inserting a New Column:

A new column is inserted at the second position in the original worksheet to store the results of the check.
Opening the SharePoint File:

The SharePoint file is opened as read-only.
Loop and Check:

The code loops through each customer in the original file.
It checks if each customer is present in the SharePoint file.
If a customer is found, their name is added to the new column; otherwise, the cell is left empty.
Cleanup:

The SharePoint workbook is closed without saving any changes.
A message box informs the user that the process is complete.
Make sure to adjust the file paths, sheet names, and any other specific details according to your needs. üßë‚Äçüíªüìä‚ú®üìùüìÇüîçüíºüòäüë®‚Äçüíºüìà
